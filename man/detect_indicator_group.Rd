\title{Auto-detect the best-matching indicator group from a vector of indicators}
\usage{
detect_indicator_group(indicators)
}
\arguments{
\item{indicators}{Character vector of indicator codes present in the data.}
}
\value{
The detected group name (character scalar).
}
\description{
Given a character vector of indicator codes present in the dataset, selects
the group whose \strong{entire universe} is present in the data (strict coverage:
\verb{group âŠ† data}). If multiple groups are fully covered, the tie is broken by
choosing the \strong{largest} universe (most specific), then alphabetically.
}
\details{
Detection considers the merged view from \code{.get_all_groups()} (i.e., built-ins
plus any user overrides registered via \code{\link[=register_indicator_group]{register_indicator_group()}}).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
inds <- c("anc1","penta1","penta3","measles1","measles2","bcg")
detect_indicator_group(inds)
}
